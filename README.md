# weatherDashboard
- MYLES BURT

I have manage to develop a basic weather dashboard as the homework asked as when you search for a city you are presented with future conditions for that city and it is added to a search history. 
When you search for a city, you are then presented with the required infor such as name, temperature, humidity, and UV Index with appropriate colour warning ranging from favourable, moderate or severe.
A five day weatehr forecast does display the date, temp and humidity over the next five days.

The project failed to meet the criteria of weather icons, using local storage to save results when refreshing, turning the search history into buttons so that previous data can be accessed again.

I recongnise that the UV Index badge bubbles and continously appends with every search, and I had trouble finding a way to use the icons from Open Weather.

I feel I've made good personal progress but, I understand my weakness lie with calling api images, local storage and that I also need to become more familiar with Moments.js or Luxon.js for better time displays.
